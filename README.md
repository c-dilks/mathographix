# pascal-cr
Pascal triangle visuals in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)

This is an update of [the slow Perl version](https://github.com/c-dilks/pascal).
The goal is to reproduce [images like these](https://github.com/c-dilks/pascal/tree/master/img)
much more efficiently.

## Usage
Build by running:
```
./build.cr
```

To generate triangles, run:
```
./pascal
```
